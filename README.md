  > 
The objective of the project is to develop a moisture sensing and temperature 
sensing cum watering system for irrigation. This system will combine cutting-edge 
hardware and software technologies to enhance the effectiveness of irrigation 
practices. The core objective is to create a system that can accurately measure the 
moisture content in a given soil sample and sense the temperature conditions at a 
given time. We then integrate those values effectively depending on the crop type to 
decide upon the adequate amount of water needed by the crop in the pertaining 
conditions. Conclusively, the circuit is a blend of moisture and temperature 
sensations aided by the type of crop in use to develop an efficient and sustainable 
system to monitor the sufficiency of water. The system will incorporate automated 
irrigation capabilities, ensuring crops receive the right amount of water at the right 
time.
